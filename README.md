Life
====

Here's a little bit about my life. Some important events that I care and could remember (you know, I'm getting old and I can't remember everything).
I used the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) pallete by Ethan Schoonover to customize the timeline.
The original project can be found here: [cheeaun.github.io/life](http://cheeaun.github.io/life).
Check it out other's people's lifes below and make your own life-timeline :D
